# ConvMF
re-implementation of [ConvMF+ (RecSys'16)](https://github.com/cartopy/ConvMF) in TensorFlow with even better performance

Our implementatation achieves 0.848 in terms of RMSE (check the log.txt) on the ML-1M dataset provided by the authors while their reported result is only 0.8549.

Each line in the input text is formatted as:

**user::item::rating::word1 word2 word3**
